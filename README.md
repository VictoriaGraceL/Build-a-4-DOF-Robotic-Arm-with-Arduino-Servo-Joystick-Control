üìö Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and control a 4-Degree-of-Freedom (4-DOF) robotic arm using an Arduino Uno, joystick modules, and servo motors. The robotic arm is controlled in real time using two joysticks that send signals to four servo motors.

The project is based on the ViaGasaFamido DIY Robot Arm Kit purchased from AliExpress.

üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Instructions
The robotic arm mechanical assembly is based on the ViaGasaFamido DIY Robot Arm Kit.

üìå Note:
The video is for assembly reference only. The arm in the video is similar, but the exact parts or appearance may slightly vary depending on the kit you purchased.

The schematics provided in this repository are for electronic wiring demonstration only and do not show the physical layout of the robotic arm.

üíª Arduino Code
The included code reads analog joystick inputs and maps them to servo motor angles to control the robotic arm.

Joystick 1 Y-axis (A1) ‚Üí Servo 2 (D4)
Joystick 2 X-axis (A2) ‚Üí Servo 3 (D6)
Joystick 2 Y-axis (A3) ‚Üí Servo 4 (D10)
The servos directly respond to joystick movements, providing real-time manual control.

üõë Important:
The simulation in Wokwi is for wiring demonstration only.
The robotic arm will not fully function in the simulator because simulators like Wokwi cannot physically model a robotic arm‚Äôs real-world movement.

üöÄ Getting Started
Assemble the robotic arm using the provided kit instructions or the YouTube reference video.

Wire the servos and joysticks to the Arduino as shown in the wiring table.

Upload the Arduino code to the Uno.

Connect the external power supply for the servos.

Control the robotic arm using the joysticks!

‚ö° Notes
Servo Power:
Do not power servos directly from the Arduino‚Äôs 5V pin. Use a stable external power source.

Simulation Disclaimer:
The wiring diagrams and simulations included here are for educational demonstration only. They do not represent the physical assembly of the robotic arm.
